SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR TINYNAV EXECUTABLES
=============================================

REQUIRED FOR ALL EXECUTABLES:
- Linux x86_64 or Windows x86_64
- No Python installation needed (bundled)
- No external dependencies

REQUIRED FOR download_log and read_serial:
- Serial port access permissions (Linux: dialout group)
- ESP32 device connected via USB


SERIAL PORT ACCESS (Linux):
----------------------------

Add user to dialout group:
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  
Then logout and login again.

Or run with sudo (not recommended):
  sudo ./download_log


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

download_log/read_serial can't open serial port:
  → Check device is connected: ls /dev/tty*
  → Add user to dialout group (see above)
  → Try different port: -p /dev/ttyUSB0

Permission denied when running executables:
  → chmod +x visualize download_log read_serial


WINDOWS NOTES:
--------------

For download_log.exe to work on Windows, windows-curses
must have been installed during the build process.

To rebuild on Windows:
  pip install windows-curses
  python build_executables.py


ABOUT GIF OUTPUT (visualize):
------------------------------

The visualize executable uses Pillow (PIL) which only supports GIF format.

Advantages:
  ✓ No external dependencies (ffmpeg not needed)
  ✓ Works out-of-the-box on any system
  ✓ Completely portable

Disadvantages:
  ✗ GIF format only (no MP4)
  ✗ Large file sizes for animations
  ✗ Limited color palette (256 colors)

If you need MP4 output:
  → Install ffmpeg on your system
  → Use the Python script directly: python3 visualize.py input.csv
  → The script can be modified to use ffmpeg writer when available

GIF vs MP4:
  • GIF: Universal compatibility, larger files, 256 colors
  • MP4: Better compression, full color, requires ffmpeg
